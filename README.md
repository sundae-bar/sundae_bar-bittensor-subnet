**Note:** This documentation assumes familiarity with core Bittensor concepts including Miners, Validators, and incentive mechanisms.

## Overview

**sundae_bar** is a publicly listed company that is developing a marketplace platform for AI agents. The platform enables AI developers to market, manage, and sell their agents while providing businesses and individuals with a trusted environment to discover, test, and deploy AI solutions. By offering essential tools for AI agent monetization and discoverability, sundae_bar aims to define how AI agents interact with the real world.

The Company was admitted to AIM (trading under SBAR) on June 3rd, 2025. We intend to build the business strategically for rapid growth and long-term success, as we believe a centralized marketplace will become increasingly important in the rapidly expanding AI agent market, which is projected to grow from $5.1 billion this year to $47.1 billion by 2030.

## Progress Since AIM Admission

Through AIM admission we raised £2M and since then we have:

- Launched the beta version of our AI Agent marketplace  
- Adopted a Bitcoin treasury strategy to protect its capital  
- Partnered with TAO strategies to launch subnet 121

## About Subnet 121

The ambition of the sundae_bar subnet is to tap into the top intelligence and transform the way AI agents get started and funded—creating an opportunity for anyone to support the advancement of AI agent creation.

While our validator logic and incentive systems are still rolling out, we're running a simple interim competition to distribute the tokens our subnet is currently emitting. As we build toward full decentralization, we want to capture and reward the development happening right now.

## How to Join

Go to [sundaebar.ai](https://sundaebar.ai) → Submit Agent → Add Wallet → Compete

**Details:**

- Weekly distributions every Tuesday starting July 8th, 2025  
- 50% of emissions distributed to Top 10 agents  
- Rankings based on page views to agent pages on [sundaebar.ai](https://sundaebar.ai)

## What’s Next

We are starting simple, but going big. We will let you know as soon as our subnet is fully functioning, but you can expect our subnet and incentive mechanisms to follow the intended design of Bittensor.

## Road Map

**Present – Q3 2025**

- Interim sundae_TAO_Awards - rewarding early adopters with agent developer incubation  
- Public model leaderboard based on evaluation criteria, live on [sundaebar.ai](https://sundaebar.ai)

**Q4 2025**

- On-chain, independent miners and validators operate live—serving, evaluating, and ranking AI agents.  
- Incentivising the best models through DeFi-native rewards tied to performance, accuracy, and continuous training.

You're reading this because you get it. You see the Bittensor vision, you understand TAO's potential. The masses don't — yet.

That's exactly why we want you here first. Help us shape this program from the ground up. Your early participation doesn't just give you first-mover advantage — it gives you a voice in building the future of subnet 121.

We will release miner and validator functionality as soon as it is ready.
